# VolunteerSystem
Summer Senior Project - Volunteer Web System Application

This is a pre-semester project for the Senior Project 1 course. The purpose of this web app is for the admin to be able to add, edit, or delete volunteers or volunteer
opportunities. No one other than a person with an admin login has access to the information or to make changes.

Features that are not working quite right:

- Filter by DateTime. 
-- We struggled using the datatype date/datetime for the first time. I (Bailey) implented the filter by date
   and was eventually able to get it to work. However, for some reason the database would not update on other
   team members system. Every person had to add the new datatype themselved otherwise the program would break
   whenever they tried to run it and select the Manage Opportunities button. 

Things our team learned and would do differently next time:

- Push to branches, not master.
- Map out how we want to in take data to limit user error. For example, radio buttons, check boxes,and drop downs instead of text boxes.
- Adding more comments to the code. 
- Following/keeping up with the Trello board in order to keep track of each other's progress and keep up with tasks.
