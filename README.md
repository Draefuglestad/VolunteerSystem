# VolunteerSystem
Summer Senior Project - Volunteer Web System Application

This is a pre-semester project for the Senior Project 1 course. The purpose of this web app is for the admin to be able to add, edit, or delete volunteers or volunteer
opportunities. No one other than a person with an admin login has access to the information or to make changes.

Features that are not working quite right:

- Filter by DateTime. 

Things our team learned and would do differently next time:

- Push to branches, not master.
- Map out how we want to in take data to limit user error. For example, radio buttons, check boxes,and drop downs instead of text boxes.
- Adding more comments to the code. 
- Following/keeping up with the Trello board in order to keep track of each other's progress and keep up with tasks.
